# Email Functionality Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Changes Made to Fix Email Issues on Vercel

1. **Enhanced Email Transporter Configuration**:
   - Added connection timeout settings to prevent hanging connections
   - Enabled connection pooling for better reliability
   - Added debug mode for non-production environments

2. **Added Retry Logic**:
   - Both `sendUserEmail` and `sendAdminEmail` functions now have retry logic
   - Implements exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) between retry attempts
   - Max 3 attempts per email before giving up
   - Skip retries for authentication errors (which won't resolve with retries)

3. **Added Startup Diagnostics**:
   - Created a `testEmailOnStartup` function that runs in production
   - Logs detailed information about the email configuration
   - Verifies the email transporter during startup
   - Helps with easier debugging of Vercel deployment issues

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Better error messages for common issues like Gmail authentication problems
   - Detailed logging when email sending fails
   - Information about potential Gmail App Password issues

5. **Removed Dashboard**:
   - Removed all admin dashboard related files
   - Removed admin API endpoints
   - Added a redirect from admin page to home
   - Simplified application structure

## How to Test and Verify

1. After deploying to Vercel, check the logs for the email startup diagnostics
2. Visit `/api/test-email` endpoint to check email configuration
3. Try submitting a contact form or newsletter subscription to test actual email sending

## Common Issues with Gmail on Vercel

1. **App Password Required**:
   - If you have 2FA enabled on your Gmail account, you must use an App Password
   - Regular password will not work even if correct

2. **No Spaces in App Password**:
   - Gmail App Passwords are shown with spaces when generated, but should be used without spaces
   - The code now automatically removes spaces from the password

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all email-related environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
   - `EMAIL_USER` - Your Gmail address
   - `EMAIL_PASS` - Your Gmail App Password (without spaces)
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Email to receive admin notifications
